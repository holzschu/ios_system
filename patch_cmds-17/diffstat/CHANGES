2012/01/03 (diffstat 1.55)
	+ add -R option, like patch's, to reverse the order of the comparison.

	+ FreeBSD ports/148604, ports/149500 reported that lzcat may not
	  support extracting files compressed in xz format (patch by Frederic
	  Culot, FreeBSD #149500).

	+ address documentation issue raised in Novell #739210

	+ correct typo s/Solaris/Solar/.

	+ updated configure script macros:
	  CF_ANSI_CC_CHECK CF_DISABLE_LEAKS CF_GCC_ATTRIBUTES CF_GCC_WARNINGS
	  CF_MAKE_TAGS CF_MSG_LOG CF_PATH_PROG CF_WITH_INSTALL_PREFIX
	  CF_XOPEN_SOURCE

	+ update config.guess, config.sub

2010/10/10 (diffstat 1.54)
	+ change Debian package script to use native format.

	+ correct counts used for new files when -S/-D options are used.

	+ minor typography improvement to manpage (patch by Solar Designer)

	+ remove the temporary directory on error, introduced in 1.48+ (patch
	  by Solar Designer).

2010/07/19 (diffstat 1.53)

	+ add missing "break" statement which left "-c" option falling-through
	  into "-C".

2010/07/16 (diffstat 1.52)

	+ add "-C" option to show the histogram using SGR colors.

	+ add "-s" option to show only the summary line.

	+ add configure check for "xz", using this in preference to "lzcat"
	  (FreeBSD #148604).

	+ also escape literal dashes used as part of the histogram in the
	  manpage.

	+ modify hyphens vs dashes in manpage per
		http://lintian.debian.org/tags/hyphen-used-as-minus-sign.html
	  (patch by Francois Marier).

	+ drop mkdirs.sh, use "mkdir -p"

	+ add configure checks for ctags and lint.

	+ updated configure macros

	+ reformat CHANGES to work with metrics script.

	+ fix strict gcc warnings, e.g., using const.

	+ improve a case where filenames have embedded blanks (patch by Reinier
	  Post).

	+ update config.guess, config.sub

2009/11/07 (diffstat 1.51)

	+ correct suffix-check for ".xz" files as command-line parameters
	  rather than as piped input (report by Moritz Barsnick).

2009/11/6 (diffstat 1.50)

	+ build/test fixes for MSYS, i.e., MinGW.

	+ improve configure check for get_unlocked function.

	+ use $TMPDIR for path of temporary file used in decompression.
	
	+ correct else-condition for detecting compression type (patch by Zach
	  Hirsch).

2009/08/31 (diffstat 1.49)

	+ improve lzma support, add support for xz (patch by Eric Blake).
	
	+ add special case for no-newline message from some diff's (Ubuntu
	  #269895).

	+ improve configure check for getopt header.

	+ add configure special case for HPUX 11 with _XOPEN_SOURCE definition.

	+ update config.guess, config.sub

2009/08/11 (diffstat 1.48)

	+ add decompression tests for lzma and pack file types.

	+ check for zcat and uncompress in preference to "compress -dc".

	+ modify to check the first few bytes of standard input, and use a
	  corresponding decompression utility if the stream appears to be
	  compressed.  This requires making a temporary copy of the data
	  (Debian #491575).

	+ add -N option, to truncate filenames.

	+ use getc_unlocked() rather than fgetc_unlocked()

	+ modify to recognize Perforce-style diffs (patch by Ed Schouten).

	  $PATH_SEPARATOR rather than $PATH_SEP (for consistency with some
	  autoconf versions),

	+ fix typo in configure --with-install-prefix option (report by
	  Dagobert Michelsen).

	+ update config.guess, config.sub

2009/03/29 (diffstat 1.47)

	modify to work with patch ".rej" files, which do not have a header to
	tell which file is affected.

	fix typo in usage message (reports by Moritz Barsnick, John McNamara,
	Richard Quadling).

2008-08-06 (diffstat 1.46)

	+ add "-S", "-D" and "-m" options to provide a way to show the amount
	  of difference relative to the total sizes of the files.

	+ add "-q" option (Debian #488248, patch by Greg Norris).

2007/09/04 (diffstat 1.45)

	+ add "-b" option (Debian #379380, patch by Greg Norris).

2007/08/26 (diffstat 1.44)

	+ add a check for default-diff output, e.g., "diff foo bar|diffstat",
	  which has no "diff" command in the output for diffstat to guess that
	  a diff is beginning.

	+ add a check after completing a chunk for unified diff to ensure that
	  the next line either begins another chunk for the diff, or starts
	  another diff, e.g., a context diff (report by Adrian Bunk).

	+ add configure options for leak-checking valgrind, etc.

	+ use install-sh rather than install.sh

	+ updated config.guess and config.sub

	+ updated configure macros CF_GCC_ATTRIBUTES CF_GCC_WARNINGS CF_MSG_LOG
	  CF_PATH_SYNTAX CF_VERBOSE CF_XOPEN_SOURCE

2006/07/16 (diffstat 1.43)

	+ fix to avoid modifying data which is being used by tsearch() for
	  ordering the binary tree (report by Adrian Bunk).

2006/07/02 (diffstat 1.42)

	+ do not ignore pathnames in /tmp/, since some tools create usable
	  for both old/new files there (Debian #376086).

	+ correct ifdef for fgetc_unlocked().

	+ updated configure macros CF_GCC_VERSION, CF_PATH_SYNTAX and
	  CF_XOPEN_SOURCE

	+ add configure check for compress, gzip and bzip2 programs that may be
	  used to decompress files.

2005/08/24 (diffstat 1.41)

	+ update usage message for options added in 1.40 (report by Eric Blake).

2005-08-15 (diffstat 1.40)

	+ add options -l, -r and -t.  add to -f option (patch, comments by
	  Jean Delvare, Michael Burian).

	+ improve I/O on Linux using fgetc_locked().

	+ improve searching of long sorted lists using tsearch()

	+ improve configure-script checks for Intel compiler warnings.

2005-04-10 (diffstat 1.39)

	+ change order of merging and prefix-stripping so stripping all prefixes,
	  e.g., with -p9, will be sorted as expected (patch by Jean Delvare).

	+ correct a reference to freed memory after merging found with valgrind.

2005-01-16 (diffstat 1.38)

	+ add makefile.wnt, etc., for win32 port.

	+ fix "make check" to work even when PATH or the build directory has
	  spaces in it (patch by Eric Blake).

	+ add support for '--help' and '--version' command line arguments, for a
	  consistent interface with GNU tools, and still compatible to POSIX
	  requirements on utility options (patch by Eric Blake).

2004-12-18

	+ modify makefile.in and run_test.sh to allow "make check" to be run
	  from a build directory which is not the same as the source directory,
	  i.e., when the configure --srcdir option is used (request by Eric
	  Blake).

	+ modify distribution to include sample of regression tests, so a
	  "make check" will work (request by Eric Blake).

2004-12-16 (diffstat 1.37)

	+ fix a different case for data beginning with "--" which was treated
	  as a header line.

2004-12-14 (diffstat 1.36)

	+ Fix allocation problems.  Open files in binary mode for reading.
	  Getopt returns -1, not necessarily EOF.  Add const where useful.  Use
	  NO_IDENT where necessary.  malloc() comes from <stdlib.h> in standard
	  systems (Patch by Eric Blake <ebb9@byu.net>.)

2004-11-08 (diffstat 1.35)

	+ modify makefile.in to work with configure --srcdir option (report by
	  Eric Blake).

	+ minor fix for resync of unified diffs checks for range (line beginning
	  with '@' without header lines (successive lines beginning with "---"
	  and "+++") (Debian #264098).

	+ miscellaneous updates for configure script

2003-11-09 (diffstat 1.34)

	+ improve check for certain lines (not those that begin a chunk) that
	  begin with '-', treating all except "---" as a delete (report by
	  James Rowe <Jay@jnrowe.uklinux.net>).

	+ minor updates to configure script.

2003-02-14 (diffstat 1.33)

	+ modified to work around a case where the filename+date was incomplete,
	  i.e., missing one of the components such as the day of the month.
	  While diffstat does not use the date directly, it helps distinguish
	  some lines from non-patches (report by Moritz Barsnick
	  <moritz@barsnick.net>).

	+ add "-h" option (request by Moritz Barsnick).

	+ fix a typo in usage message (report by Moritz Barsnick).

	+ add "-e" and "-o" options to simplify testing on OS/2 EMX.

2003-01-04 (diffstat 1.32)

	+ modified to handle patches generated by makepatch-2.00_09, which uses
	  both "Index" and "diff" lines (report by D Roland Walker).  As a side
	  effect, the additional merging eliminates occasional reports with
	  zero differences.

	+ modified to avoid buffer overflows.

	+ fixes for Debian #155000 (did not handle a '-' in first content-column
	  of a unified diff) and #170947 (option to turn the progress messages
	  off).

	+ updated configure script using aclocal.m4 macros

	+ update makefile.in to improve use of autoconf (report/patch by Nix
	  <nix@esperi.demon.co.uk>).

2002-08-20 (diffstat 1.31)

	+ add -u, -k options to override diffstat's normal sorting (-u) and
	  merging (-k) of identical filenames.  (-u requested by H Peter Anvin
	  <hpa@zytor.com>).

2002-08-09 (diffstat 1.30)

	+ allow either '/' or '-' as delimiters in dates, to accommodate
	  gendiff (report by Rik van Riel <riel@conectiva.com.br>).  This
	  corresponds to the time format used in diffutils 2.8 whose changelog
	  states that this is ISO 8601 (though online references differ).

2001-10-10 (diffstat 1.29)

	+ add bzip2 (.bz2) suffix (suggested by Gregory T Norris
	  <haphazard@socket.net>, Debian #82969).

	+ add check for diff from RCS archive where the "diff" lines do not
	  reference a filename.

2000-03-29 (diffstat 1.28)

	+ Add -c option (to prefix output with '#' comment), eliminating a step
	  in my script that combines diffstat output with a patch.  This is a
	  workaround for OSF1's broken sed utility.

	+ Check for compressed file suffixes .Z and .gz, read uncompressed data
	  via pipe (Debian wishlist item #53975 by ch@lathspell.westend.com).

	+ Simplified makefile based on comments by M Sweger
	  <mikesw@whiterose.net>

	+ Adapted changes from Troy Engel <tengel@sonic.net> as "-f" option.

1998-05-27 (diffstat 1.27)

	+ Debian diff's don't show dates on the lines where we expect to see
	  filenames.

1998-01-16 (diffstat 1.26, Patch 5)

	+ Change copyright terms.

 	+ Accommodate patches w/o tabs in header lines (e.g., from cut/paste).
	  Still prefer the tabs because otherwise we cannot have spaces in
	  filenames.

 	+ Strip suffixes such as ".orig", to avoid confusing output.

1996-03-16 (diffstat 1.24, Patch 4)

	+ Corrected state-transition after "Binary".

	+ Added testing subdirectory

	+ Added -p option.

	+ Handle differences from /tmp (e.g., for X11R5 patches).

1995-05-06 (diffstat 1.17 Patch 3)

	+ Repost whole program to comp.sources.misc (1.17)

	+ Mods to scaling: limit to 1:1 if only a few changes were made; added
	  logic to accumulate error across +/-/!  calls.

	+ added logic to recognize 'rcsdiff -u' output.

1994-12-26 (diffstat 1.15, Patch 2)

	+ Strip common pathname prefix (1.15)

1994-11-13 (diffstat 1.14, Patch 1)

	+ Test for <string.h> vs <strings.h>

	+ Corrected error in 'match()' that didn't handle properly the case
	  when an argument was a null string (i.e., blank lines in a unified
	  diff).

	+ Added options '-n' and '-V'

	+ Added patchlev.h, CHANGES files.

	+ Added install.sh, for autoconf 2.1

1994-06-13 (diffstat 1.12, Patch 0)

	+ Initial release of 'diffstat' (1.12).
